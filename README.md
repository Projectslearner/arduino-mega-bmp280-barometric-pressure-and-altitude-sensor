# BMP280 Barometric Pressure and Altitude Sensor

#### Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to interface the BMP280 barometric pressure and altitude sensor module with an Arduino Mega. The BMP280 sensor is capable of measuring atmospheric pressure and temperature, making it suitable for applications requiring environmental monitoring and altitude estimation. By accurately reading pressure and temperature, the sensor allows for precise altitude calculations based on atmospheric pressure variations.

#### Components Needed

1. **Arduino Mega**
2. **BMP280 Barometric Pressure and Altitude Sensor Module**
3. **Jumper Wires**

#### Block Diagram


#### Circuit Setup

1. **Connect the BMP280 to Arduino Mega:**
   - **VCC** to **5V**
   - **GND** to **GND**
   - **SCL** to **SCL (Pin 21)**
   - **SDA** to **SDA (Pin 20)**

#### Instructions

1. **Install Required Libraries:**
   - Open Arduino IDE, navigate to **Sketch** > **Include Library** > **Manage Libraries**.
   - Search for and install the `Adafruit BMP280` library.

2. **Circuit Setup:**
   - Connect the BMP280 module to the Arduino Mega following the connections outlined in the circuit setup section.

3. **Code Upload:**
   - Copy and paste the provided code into a new sketch in the Arduino IDE.
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Mega.

4. **Testing:**
   - Once the code is uploaded, open the Arduino IDE serial monitor to observe the sensor data.
   - The serial monitor will display temperature readings in degrees Celsius (°C) and pressure readings in hectopascals (hPa).

#### Applications

- **Weather Monitoring:** Monitor atmospheric pressure and temperature for weather-related applications.
- **Altitude Measurement:** Calculate altitude based on atmospheric pressure readings.
- **Environmental Sensing:** Monitor changes in atmospheric conditions for environmental studies.

#### Notes

- Ensure correct wiring and orientation of the BMP280 sensor for accurate pressure and temperature measurements.
- Adjust the delay time in the `loop()` function to control data sampling frequency as needed.
- Calibrate the sensor if precise measurements are required for specific applications.
